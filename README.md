Books with Friends

As the name implies, Books with Friends is intended to be a small social review app for readers to check out books their friends have read! It allows for an out-of-ten review and a quick written review of what you liked and what you didn't. You can also keep up with your friends and see what they've reviewed and chronicle your own reading journey.

To install the program, just open your terminal and run the following:

```git clone git@github.com:Dbm289/books_with_friends.git

Then enter 

```cd books_with_friends

Before starting, make sure you

```bundle install

Running 

```rails db:seed

will add a few sample users and reviews to your database so you can get a feel for the site.

You can run the program from a localhost by running 

```rails s

in your terminal.
